# Fix Summary for Loudness Controller Issues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Notification Buttons Not Showing
**Problem**: The Loudness Controller notification only showed "Target 91 Phon" text without any buttons.

**Root Cause**: 
- The notification was using custom RemoteViews which may not be compatible with all Android versions
- The notification channel had `IMPORTANCE_NONE` which prevents interactions

**Solution**:
- Changed `LoudnessNotificationHelper.createLoudnessNotification()` to use `createCompactNotification()` instead of `createExpandedNotification()` for better compatibility
- Updated notification channel importance from `IMPORTANCE_NONE` to `IMPORTANCE_LOW` to enable user interactions
- The compact notification uses standard Android notification actions which are more reliable across different Android versions

### 2. Filter Not Updating When Sliders Change
**Problem**: The convolver wasn't loading the correct filter or updating the filter name when volume sliders change.

**Root Cause**:
- The `updateLoudness()` method in LoudnessController wasn't being called when sliders were released
- The UI was showing a simplified filter name that didn't match the actual filter selection logic

**Solution**:
- Added `loudnessController.updateLoudness()` call in `applyLoudnessSettings()` to force filter update when sliders are released
- Updated the filter name display in `updateCalculationDetails()` to match the exact logic from LoudnessController:
  - Rounds reference phon to available values (75, 80, 85, 90)
  - Uses 90.0-90.0_filter.wav when actual phon >= 90
  - Formats filter names with 1 decimal place
- Added `controller.updateLoudness()` in the notification receiver to ensure filter updates when using notification buttons

## Files Modified

   - Updated filter name display logic to match LoudnessController
   - Added updateLoudness() call in applyLoudnessSettings()

3. `/app/src/main/java/me/timschneeberger/rootlessjamesdsp/utils/notifications/Notifications.kt`
   - Changed notification channel importance from IMPORTANCE_NONE to IMPORTANCE_LOW

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Notification Buttons**:
   - Enable loudness controller
   - Check that the notification shows with +1/-1 buttons and ON/OFF toggle
   - Verify that tapping the buttons changes the target phon value
   - Confirm that the notification updates immediately after button press

2. **Test Filter Updates**:
   - Open Loudness Controller activity
   - Move the Real Volume slider and release
   - Check that the filter name in the calculation details updates correctly
   - Verify in logs that the convolver is loading the correct filter file
   - Test with different reference phon values (75, 80, 85, 90)
   - Confirm that actual phon >= 90 always uses 90.0-90.0_filter.wav

## Additional Notes

- The notification now uses standard Android notification actions which are more reliable
- The filter update is forced when sliders are released to ensure immediate DSP updates
- The filter name display now exactly matches the filter selection logic to avoid confusion
