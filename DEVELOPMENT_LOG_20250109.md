## Loudness Controller Major Refactoring

### Summary
Major refactoring of the Loudness Controller to improve terminology consistency, add RMS offset functionality, and fix filter selection logic.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Terminology Standardization (SPL → Phon)
- **Rationale**: "Phon" is the correct unit for loudness level, while SPL (Sound Pressure Level) is a physical measurement
- **Changes**:
  - Renamed all `targetSpl` → `targetPhon`
  - Renamed all `referenceLevel` → `referencePhon`
  - Updated UI labels: "Real Volume" → "Target Phon", "Reference" → "Reference Phon"
  - Fixed method names in `ConfigFileWatcher.kt`

#### 2. RMS Offset Feature Implementation
- **Purpose**: Account for the difference between 0dB pink noise reference and actual music RMS levels
- **Implementation**:
  - Added RMS offset slider (0-14 dB range)
  - Default value: 10 dB (typical for most music)
  - Formula: `Actual Phon = Target Phon - RMS Offset`
- **Benefit**: More accurate loudness perception for real music content

#### 3. FIR Filter Selection Fix
- **Problem**: Filter selection was showing incorrect values (e.g., 64.2-80.0_filter instead of proper values)
- **Solution**:
  - Reference phon now rounds to available values: 75, 80, 85, 90
  - Example: Reference phon 83 → rounds to 85
  - Added debug logging to track filter selection

#### 4. Code Quality Improvements
- Added comprehensive debug logging
- Fixed compilation errors from incomplete refactoring
- Improved filter path calculation with proper rounding logic
- Force loudness update on activity start to ensure correct filter selection

### Technical Details

#### Filter Selection Logic
```kotlin
// Round reference phon to available values
val roundedReferencePhon = when {
    referencePhon < 77.5f -> 75f
    referencePhon < 82.5f -> 80f
    referencePhon < 87.5f -> 85f
    else -> 90f
}
```

#### RMS Offset Application
```kotlin
fun getActualPhon(): Float {
    return targetPhon - rmsOffset
}
```

### Testing Notes
- With Target Phon 82.1, Reference Phon 83.0, RMS Offset 10:
  - Actual Phon = 72.1
  - Rounded Reference = 85
  - Selected Filter: 72.1-85.0_filter.wav

### Known Issues Resolved
- Fixed TransactionTooLargeException by disabling state saving on large TextViews
- Fixed auto reference mode not updating when target phon changes
- Fixed filter naming precision (always use 1 decimal place)

### Future Considerations
- Consider adding presets for different music genres (classical, pop, EDM) with appropriate RMS offsets
- Potential for automatic RMS detection from actual playback
