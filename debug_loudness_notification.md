# Debug Loudness Notification Issue

## Changes Made

1. **Added debug logging** throughout the notification creation process:
   - In `RootlessAudioProcessorService.kt` when checking if loudness is enabled
   - In `LoudnessNotificationHelper.kt` when creating the notification
   - Added try-catch blocks to capture any exceptions

2. **Created a dedicated notification channel** for Loudness Controller:
   - Added `CHANNEL_LOUDNESS_CONTROL` constant in `Notifications.kt`
   - Created channel with `IMPORTANCE_DEFAULT` (higher than the service channel's `IMPORTANCE_LOW`)
   - Updated all notification builders to use the new channel

3. **Added notification channel creation** before posting:
   - Ensures channels are created before attempting to post the notification
   - This handles cases where the app might have been updated

4. **Added trigger mechanism** from LoudnessControllerActivity:
   - Added `triggerLoudnessNotificationUpdate()` method
   - Calls this after enabling loudness in calibration and apply settings

## What to Check

1. **Check Logcat** for these debug messages:
   ```
   Loudness notification check: isLoudnessEnabled=true/false
   Creating loudness notification...
   createLoudnessNotification called
   Loudness values: targetPhon=X, actualPhon=Y, isEnabled=true/false
   Creating compact notification with channel: loudness_control
   Loudness notification created, notifying with ID=5
   Loudness notification posted successfully
   ```

2. **Check for errors** in Logcat:
   ```
   Failed to create/post loudness notification
   ```

3. **Verify notification settings**:
   - Go to Android Settings > Apps > JamesDSP > Notifications
   - Check if "Loudness Controller" channel is visible
   - Ensure it's not disabled or set to silent

4. **Check notification shade**:
   - The loudness notification should appear as a persistent notification
   - It should show "Loudness: ON" with target/actual phon values
   - It should have -1, ON/OFF, and +1 action buttons

## Possible Issues

1. **Notification channel not created**: The new channel might not be created if the app wasn't restarted
2. **Notification permissions**: On Android 13+, notification permission might be denied
3. **DND mode**: Do Not Disturb might be blocking the notification
4. **Battery optimization**: Aggressive battery optimization might prevent background notifications

## Next Steps

If the notification still doesn't appear:

1. Force stop and restart the app
2. Check if notification permission is granted (Android 13+)
3. Try uninstalling and reinstalling the app to ensure clean channel creation
4. Check if other JamesDSP notifications are visible
5. Look for any security apps that might be blocking notifications
